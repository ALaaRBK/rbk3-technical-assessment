# Welcome to your assessment  

Are you ready to put your skills to the test and have some full stack hacking fun? This assessment will be like a day-long solo sprint where you get use the skills and technologies you have worked with during the first half of the course. You should expect to revisit concepts and techniques you are familiar with while learning some new content as well.

### Don'ts

- Don't freak out
- Don't collaborate with other students in any way whatsoever
- Don't communicate with others through any communication channel
- Don't wait until the end to commit all your work

### Dos

- Do commit frequently
- Do use Google, MDN, Stack Overflow, documentation, etc. to support you in your work
- Do ask help if you have any issues with the codebase or your computer
- Do ask help if you have any clarifying questions
- Do ask help should you need an exception to any of the above

This assement is designed to test what you have learned over the last 6 weeks.

### Guidelines

This Assesment is split into 4 different parts. Each part is in each own folder and has it's own README file. Please read this README first, then refer to the README for each section. Each README has it's own rules on what resources you are allowed to use. At no point are you allowed to use your prior sprint code, work with any partner or look at your neighbors code. Cheaters will be removed!


We believe this is a worthy challenge for you!
